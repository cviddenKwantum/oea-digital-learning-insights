The [OEA Digital Equity of Access Package - Use Case Documentation](https://github.com/cviddenKwantum/oea-digital-learning-insights/blob/6f6e676f96964a9e8eba7e5dbb8a77182737cb42/Digital_Equity_of_Access/docs/OEA%20Digital%20Learning%20Package%20-%20Access%20Use%20Case.pdf) provides guidance on the end-to-end process of developing a successful Chronic Absenteeism use case project. This document includes 
 - defining of the use case problem,
 - key stakeholder identification and engagement in the project,
 - mapping research theory to data,
 - and implementing principles of responsible data and AI in the process of predictive modelling. 
The use case document was completed in collaboration with through a partnership between Microsoft Education, [Kwantum Analytics](https://www.kwantumanalytics.com/), and [Fresno Unified School District](https://www.fresnounified.org/) in Fresno, California.
